My name is Ryan Conway. I'm a software engineer with an empathy for the user that compels me to focus on the human aspects of the systems I work with. I specialize in building things that are intuitive and pleasant to use, be they consumed by end users or other developers.

My professional work is primarily on web backends and embedded devices, but I'm a generalist. I believe that there are core principles of engineering that apply to all specialized forms of it, and that a talented engineer can readily apply these principles to any specific area.

My hobbyist work lately revolves around emulation of video game console hardware and tangible devices.

I am always interested in contributing to projects that are meaningful to me. If you are recruiting for a project that might be relevant to my skills, be it corporate or not, please reach out using the information available in [my résumé][link-resume].

Thank you for having an interest in my site.
