Hello! I'm Ryan.

I'm a backend software engineer by trade. I'm generally known for my interest in detail, knowledge of programming languages, and distaste for nullability.

My career and personal projects have also involved embedded devices, video game hardware emulation, and frontend development. Whatever the field, I try to create systems that are intuitive to their users and to those maintaining them.

If you are recruiting for a project that might be relevant to my skills, please reach out using the information available in [my résumé][link-resume]. I'm happiest working with people whose company I enjoy on products I feel benefit society.

Thank you for your interest.
